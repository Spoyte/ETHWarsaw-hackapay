## the problem it solves

The current process for distributing hackathon bounties faces several challenges:

1. Time-consuming: The distribution of bounties often experiences significant delays.
2. Communication gaps: There's often a lack of effective information sharing between hackathon organizers and bounty-distributing teams.
3. Inconsistent follow-through: In some cases, promised bounties may not be paid out at all.

These issues can lead to frustration for participants and potentially discourage future participation in hackathons. Our project aims to streamline this process, ensuring timely and reliable bounty distribution.

##Challenges I ran into

## Challenges I Ran Into

1. Time Constraints: I initiated the project later than ideal, which significantly reduced the available development time.

2. Technical Hurdles: 
   - Frontend Development: As this is not my primary area of expertise, I encountered unexpected difficulties in implementing the user interface.
   - Database Management: Working with SQL and Node.js presented challenges that were more time-consuming than anticipated.

3. Learning Curve: Adapting to new technologies and frameworks within the limited timeframe proved challenging.

4. Feature Prioritization: Due to time limitations, I had to make tough decisions on which features to prioritize and which to postpone.

Despite these challenges, the project provided valuable learning experiences and insights for future hackathons and development projects.
